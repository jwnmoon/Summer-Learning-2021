  <main>
    <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Jiwon and I'm a sophomore at St Olaf College majoring in Computer Science. 
    <br> I'm always eager to learn about new topics in tech, so I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS during my freshman summer and create this website. 
    <br> I’ve included my resume and personal projects related to my hobbies on this website. 
    <br> Feel free to look around and connect with me on Linkedin or Github :-) I'll also leave my email: jiwonjmoon@gmail.com

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <header>COVID-19 Dashboard Project - Python</header>
      <p> 
        This was the final assignment for my Intro to CS class in college, and it was also the very first CS project I've ever created!
        <br> I created a desktop application with a GUI that displays COVID-19 statistics by colleges in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.         <br> I was able to learn how to structure the in python, work with classes, and run tkinter. 
        <br> Here are some photos of the program, as well as the link to the full code.

      </p>

      <header>Stoinder(St Olaf + Tinder) Project - C++, React Native </header>
      <p>This was a team project for my Software Design class. This is a web application with a client-server model that allows users to anonymously submit messages and display them on a feed.
        <br> There is a Facebook page called "St Olaf Flirts", which St Olaf students often use to anonymously submit "flirts" using a form, and an admin would then upload those "flirts" on a page. 
        <br> Me and my team decided to create a "clone" of this page using C++ and React Native. Building this project was by far one of the hardest things I've ever did, but I learned so much out of it!
        <br> One of the most important things I learned was how to integrate the front-end and back-end to create a smooth program. 
        <br> It was confusing how to make the front and back-end communicate with each other, but it worked out in the end!
        <br> I also learned how to read other people's code and use git and gitlab. 
        <br> Here are some photos of the program -- I also included some comments on how the program works.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <header>Baking</header>
      <p>I am a self-taught baker. 
      <br> I’ve been baking since 7th grade, which was when my family first had an oven in the house! 
      <br> My specialty is breakfast bread, but I also enjoy baking pastries and yeast bread. I love to mess around with recipes, experimenting with new ingredients and creating new flavors and textures. 
      <br> My baking recipes are often new derivatives of existing recipes, so I always have to document them somewhere for future uses. 
      <br> This is why I'm currently working on building a recipe app to store all my recipes. Check back in a couple weeks to see my baking recipe app! </p>
      <header>Baseball</header>
      <p>I am a Korean baseball(KBO) junkie! 
      <br> I am a proud fan of the Kia Tigers :-) My parents were born and raised near the city in which the team is based, so they naturally became fans and so did I. 
      <br> The Tigers have won the Korean Series the most number of times in the league - 11 times with a perfect 11-0 record! 
      <br> They haven't been doing well the past few years, but I sometimes wonder -- when will they win their next championship?
      <br> This is why I am currently learning the basics of machine learning to create a simple program that would predict the standings of the 10 teams in the KBO based on past standings.
